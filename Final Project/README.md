# The Haunted House: A Text-based Choose Your Own Adventure Game

## Deep in the woods and overlooking dark, ragged cliffs, the house stood over the sea, seemingly guarding the town from some unseen evil. No one knows how old the house is or who built it, for even the oldest residents cannt remember a time without it. The doors never open and the windows never broke, despite the efforts of many hungry for excitement. It has become a local tradition for all residents in the town to try, doubtlessly unsuccessful, to break in. But when the doors open on their own for you and your friends late one night, you may finally get to the bottom of the mystery.
